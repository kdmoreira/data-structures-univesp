# Data Structures C++ - COM160/UNIVESP

Here are some data structures in C++ for the Data Structure course (COM160) at UNIVESP.  
Some are implemented in different ways and each folder contains source files, headers and an executable file. Inside the file containing the main function, there's an example of how the data structure can be used.  
Professor: Ulisses Martins.
